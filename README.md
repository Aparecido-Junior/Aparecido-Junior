I am currently a Master’s student at Kaplan Institute in Sydney. With a data-oriented curriculum, I am putting into practice what I have been studying for months: data collection, cleaning, exploration, transformation, and sharing — areas I am truly passionate about. In this portfolio, I share not only my academic work but also personal projects that reflect my journey into the data world.
